    <div class="long"> A native of Australia and New Guinea, White's tree frogs are an adaptable species of tree frog. A milky white coating called "caerviein" helps them survive in dry areas, allowing them to live in agricultural and suburban areas.One of the most enjoyable
      qualities of White’s tree frogs is their tremendous appetite. They are rarely fussy feeders and accept the usual variety of feeder insects, including crickets, earth worms, wax worms,slugs, and roaches.</div>

      <h1 class="white">"Native Habitat White's tree frog is native to Australia and southern New Guinea and has been introduced to New Zealand. "" </h1>
      <p>These frogs range in color from a light blue to emerald green or almost gray across their backs and milky white bellies. Females have white throats, and males have a grayish wrinkled vocal sac underneath their throat. Like many other tree frogs,
        White's tree frogs can change color to some degree. These frogs have enormous toe pads with partial webbing between fingers and almost complete webbing between toes. The eye has a horizontal pupil; most other tree frogs have vertical pupils. The
        fatty ridge over the eye is a distinctive feature of the species. Size White's tree frogs are rather large, ranging in length from 3 to 4.5 inches (7 to 11.5 centimeters). Females are usually slightly bigger than the males. Native Habitat White's
        tree frog is native to Australia and southern New Guinea and has been introduced to New Zealand. These tree frogs can live in either seasonally dry or wet habitats. They prefer moist, forested environments but have skin that can adjust to drier
        situations. White's tree frogs do not typically live in or near water, but instead live in trees. Rain collects on leaves, in cup-shaped plants and in crevices in tree trunks, allowing the frogs access to water. These places are replenished with
        water from the almost daily rains and the frogs always have a source of water to keep themselves moist. White's tree frogs are not strictly limited to tropical rain forests. In other forests, these frogs avoid desiccation in the dry season by
        taking refuge in tree hollows or secreting a milky substance called "caerviein." They cover their bodies in a cocoon that prevents them from losing too much moisture. This frog's adaptability allows it to share suburban and agricultural areas
        with humans. They have been found in bathrooms, water tanks and city reservoirs. During the hot summer months, they can appear on the verandas of homes, or actually enter homes, looking for moisture.</p>

    <div class="five"> Class: Amphibia Order: Anura Family: Hylidae Genus and Species: Litoria caerulea Fun fact! The species name caerulea means blue in Latin. This is interesting because they are not usually seen as blue, but as bright green.</div>

      <h1 class="white" "font-size: 4vw;">Communication</h1> When threatened, they emit an ear-piercing distress call. Food/Eating Habits They eat mainly insects such as moths, locusts and roaches. At the Smithsonian's National Zoo, they eat crickets and cockroaches. Reproduction and Development White's
      tree frogs reach sexual maturity in their second year. In the summer rainy season, they feast for a few days then start to breed. During the mating season, males grow a black pad on their thumb to help in gripping the females during mating, which
      can last for days while the female lays her eggs. The female expels her eggs with such force that they go through the deposited sperm cloud and stop up to 1.5 feet (0.5 meters) away. A clutch can contain from 150 to 300 eggs. Once fertilized, the
      eggs sink to the bottom. Hatching begins about 28 to 36 hours after laying. Metamorphosis can occur in two to three weeks in good conditions. Lifespan The average life span is about 16 years, but one is recorded to have lived 21 years in human care.
      One of the most popular pet amphibians, wild-caught Indonesian White’s tree frogs can be found for sale at most pet stores in North America. A better option though is to search for captive-bred individuals. Captive-bred White’s tree frogs are most
      often available in color forms such as blue or the white spotted snowflake morph. Herp shows and online vendors are good places to find captive-bred White’s tree frogs if none are available locally.
